# About
The Moore.io Arm® AMBA® IP Suite's Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI)-Stream UVM Agent is a compact, sequence-based solution to Driving/Monitoring both sides of an AXI-Stream interface.  This project consists of the agent (`uvma_axis_pkg`), the self-testing UVM environment (`uvme_axis_st_pkg`) and the test bench (`uvmt_axis_st_pkg`) to verify the agent against itself.
