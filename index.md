## About
The [Moore.io](https://www.mooreio.com) Arm® AMBA® IP Suite's Advanced eXtensible Interface-Stream (AXI-Stream) (AXI-S) (AXIS) UVM Agent is a compact, sequence-based solution to Driving/Monitoring both sides of an AXI-Stream interface.  This project consists of the agent (`uvma_axis_pkg`), the self-testing UVM environment (`uvme_axis_st_pkg`) and the test bench (`uvmt_axis_st_pkg`) to verify the agent against itself.
